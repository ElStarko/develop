<p> Version control is a system that manages changes to a project's source code or other files over time. It allows multiple contributors to work on the same project simultaneously, track changes, and collaborate efficiently. There are two main types of version control systems:

* Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS): In CVCS, a central server stores the entire history of the project, and developers check out a copy of the code to work on it. Examples include CVS (Concurrent Versions System) and Subversion.

* Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS): In DVCS, each developer has a complete copy of the project, including its entire history. Git and Mercurial are examples of distributed version control systems.

Git is one of the most widely used version control systems. It is distributed, open-source, and highly flexible. Developers often use platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket to host Git repositories and facilitate collaboration.
Effective use of version control is a fundamental practice in software development, enabling teams to work more efficiently, maintain code quality, and collaborate seamlessly. 

Git is the version control system that manages the changes locally on a developer's machine, while GitHub is a web-based platform that provides a centralized location for hosting Git repositories and facilitates collaboration among developers. Many other platforms, such as GitLab and Bitbucket, also offer similar services, but GitHub is one of the most widely used and recognized.

Git fetch basically imports the commits to local branches so as to keep up-to-date that what everybody is working on. Git Pull basically brings the local branch up-to-date with the remote copy that will also updates the other remote tracking branches.

git rebase is a command that helps you reorganize or combine changes in your Git history. It allows you to move, edit, or merge commits to create a cleaner and more linear project history.
 "git checkout feature-branch"
 "git rebase main"


git cherry-pick is a command that allows you to pick specific commits from one branch and apply them onto another branch. It's like saying, "I want just these changes, not everything from that branch.
 "git checkout destination-branch"
 "git cherry-pick <commit-hash>"
